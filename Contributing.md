Everybody is welcome to contribute to this project.

_The following stipulations are made in the interest of fairness and openness..._

## Code of conduct

* This project must not be used to harass any person or to express predjudices toward any person.
* Contributors to this project are expected to uphold standards of kindness and inclusion.
* No person should feel that they cannot contribute or are unwelcome to contribute by virtue of any aspect of their identity.
* Hate speech, predjudicial behaviour, or other forms of discrimination are not welcome.
* Violators of these very reasonable requirements will not be permitted to participate in the project.

## License

A license will be selected soon, and the key features will be:

* The project will remain open source.
* The project will be a community project - anyone may contribute.
* The project will remain free to use, and not carry adverts.
* Code from this project, or derivative projects (forks), must be made available free of charge.
* Any binaries create or distributed, from this project or forks, must be made available free of charge.
* All forks should credit the original author, and all contributors to the original project.
* A list of contributors will be maintained at this repository.

### Forks

* Forks of the project are welcomed.
* It should be clear to users and to developers that any fork is a fork.
* Forks should contain information for developers/users directing them back to the main fork.
* Developers working on forks of the project that improve or fix any part of the project are _encouraged_ (but not required) to share these changes with the original project.

### Project maintainers

* Currently, @instantiator is the sole project maintainer.
* Others wishing to help maintain the project are welcome to contact me.

## Contributions

* Contributions are welcome, and will be considered fairly.
* Decision about whether to include contributions in the main fork rest solely with project maintainers.

### New behaviours

The core purpose of the VectorPlus.Lib and VectorPlus.Web projects are to facilitate new plugins - so if you are implementing new specific behaviours for Vector robots, you will be encouraged to build those into new Plugins.

If your new behaviours have requirement from VectorPlus that can be generalised, I encourage you to add them to the main VectorPlus.Lib project.
